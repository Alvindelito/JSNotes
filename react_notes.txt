CSS
    react allows us to add CSS not just in one file, but for each different component.

Component
    A component always has the role that it must render at least something
    When naming a component, First Letter of file name must be capitalized



Class Name
    Although you can use 'class', react will give you an error to write 'className' instead.
    React uses JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like syntax in your javascript file

    Does not break separation of concern because each component are only concerned about themselves,
    meaning they are in their own universe. Each component has its own css file to worry about, meaning
    you don't have to worry about one big css file and making it easier to manage.

    React creates a virtual DOM with HTML elements, however it is not actual HTML tags

    Another thing is 'class' is a reserved keyword in Javascript.


Props
    Props can be called anything, think of them as HTML attributes

Return
    When using return(), you can only return one tag.
        <h2></h2>
        <div></div>
    The above is not allowed.

        <div>
            <h2></h2>
        </div>
    This works 


Array
    When creating an array, it has to include a key element 
    to have a unique key per element

State
    means the description of your app.
    An object that describes your application

    State lives in the parent component that passes "state" to different components

Methods
    When making your own methods on a component, use arrow functions instead of
    using a regular function syntax

Children
    using 'props.children', you can create components that wrap other components

containers (folder)
    has the class syntax and lifestyle hooks, has state in them
